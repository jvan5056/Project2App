## MVP Goals I achieved
*As a user, I want the UI to be inviting and colorful/creative, so that I am excited to use and engage with the app.
*As a user, I want the app to allow me to select a math subject and see it appear on my App header, so that I can ensure that I am getting the correct content and additional features.
*As a user, I want to view resources, example problems, videos, and lessons on a given math topic
*As a user, I want to comment on and rate resources, example problems, videos, and lessons
*As a user, I want to submit my assignments and have the answers accepted/checked for accuracy.
*As a user, I want to be able to calculate my current course grade, track my graded assignments, and calculate my potential final course grade.  
*As a user, I want to play games to help me learn and review math content



## Stretch Goals I did not get to achieve
*As a player, I want to be able to find libraries and wifi locations near me to access online math content
*As a user, I want to interact with other users and view their assignment submissions
*As a user, I want category animations and graphics, so that I can create math presentations
