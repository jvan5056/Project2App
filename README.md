## Project Description 
> This is the My Personal Math Classroom App. Users log in to create there own classroom where they can track progress, view math subject material, get resources, track there grades, turn in assignments, get math practice, and even lookup local wifi hotspots. 


## Technologies used
CSS, HTML, Javascript, Express, Node, MongoDb, Mongoose

## MVP Goals I achieved
*As a user, I want the UI to be inviting and colorful/creative, so that I am excited to use and engage with the app.
*As a user, I want the app to allow me to select a math subject and see it appear on my App header, so that I can ensure that I am getting the correct content and additional features.
*As a user, I want to view resources, example problems, videos, and lessons on a given math topic
*As a user, I want to comment on and rate resources, example problems, videos, and lessons
*As a user, I want to submit my assignments and have the answers accepted/checked for accuracy.
*As a user, I want to be able to calculate my current course grade, track my graded assignments, and calculate my potential final course grade.  
*As a user, I want to play games to help me learn and review math content



## Stretch Goals I did not get to achieve
*As a player, I want to be able to find libraries and wifi locations near me to access online math content
*As a user, I want to interact with other users and view their assignment submissions
*As a user, I want category animations and graphics, so that I can create math presentations

## Front-end
-I would like to use EJS and DOM-manipulation for my HTML.
